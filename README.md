A Holiday Ian Soundboard

See this soundboard at work here:

This is a project to fulfill one of the front end development projects which make up the Free Code Camp curriculum.

This project was initially supposed to be a drum board.

While searching for interesting drum beats, my mind raced to these old radio shows where the hosts would prank call people using a touch interface where the bord would play soundclips from different movies. These DJs on the radio would get a board of Swartzenegger quotes and use them to have conversations with random people over the phone. That is funny.

So I decided to make this work as a Holiday Ian from The First Hour show.

Techncial Process for Procuring Soundclips

I used the screen recording software ScreenFlow to pull the clips from YouTube. ScreenFlow only exports audio using lossless .aiff files. These files are about 500 kb per second so they are far larger than they need to be.

To shrink them down, I used Audacity to re-export the files to .mp3 files at 64kbps. This shrunk the file size of the audio files from around 500 kb to around 50kb.

Thank you
